# RV-ObserverSystem

## Overview

**RV-ObserverSystem** is a Unity package that provides a **customizable Observer Pattern utility**. It helps Unity developers structure their projects efficiently by implementing the Observer design pattern to manage event-driven systems.

By using RV-ObserverSystem, you can:

- Implement **event-driven architecture** with the **Observer Pattern**.
- Reduce boilerplate work when setting up new **Unity projects or features**.
- Ensure a **consistent and clean project structure** for modular game development.

## Features

- **Observer Pattern Support**: Set up Subject-Observer communication with structured scripts.
- **Decoupled Event System**: Reduce dependencies between game components.
- **Multiple File Type Support**: Easily create C# scripts, Unity scenes, JSON files, materials, and more.
- **No External Dependencies**: Works with pure C# and Unityâ€™s built-in features.

## Installation

### 1. Download or Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RomanVitolo/RV-ObserverSystem.git
```

### 2. Import into Unity

- Move the `RV - Observer Package` folder into your Unity project's `Assets` directory.
- Ensure the package is inside an `Editor` folder (if not already structured that way).
